        <p>Cricket is a sport that originated in England and is now played all around the world. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players. The objective of the game is for one team to score more runs than the other by hitting the ball with a bat and running between two sets of wooden stumps, called wickets, which are placed at either end of a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch.

          <br>One team bats while the other team bowls and fields, and after a set number of overs, the teams switch roles. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.</p>

        <p>Cricket is a sport that originated in England in the 16th century and spread to other parts of the world during the British Empire's expansion. The first recorded cricket match took place in Kent in 1646, and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was formed in 1787. International cricket matches began in the late 19th century, and the first test match was played in 1877. One-day cricket was introduced in the 1960s, and Twenty20 cricket, a faster-paced version of the game, was introduced in 2003. Today, cricket is played and watched by millions of people around the world and is considered one of the most popular sports in countries like India, Pakistan, England, Australia, South Africa, and the West Indies.</p>
