            <h1>Cricket</h1>
            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players. It originated in
                England in the 16th century and is now popular in many countries around the world, especially in
                Australia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, and the West Indies.

                The earliest known version of cricket was played in the 16th century, and by the 18th century,
                it had become a popular sport in England. The first international cricket match was played in
                1844 between Canada and the United States, and the first Test match was played in 1877 between
                England and Australia. Since then, cricket has become one of the most popular sports in the
                world, with many countries having their own national cricket teams and competitions.

                Cricket is a sport that requires skill, patience, and endurance. It can be played in different
                formats, including test cricket, one-day cricket, and T20 cricket. Test cricket is the longest
                format of the game and can last up to five days. One-day cricket, as the name suggests, is
                played in one day, with each team batting for a maximum of 50 overs. T20 cricket is the shortest
                format of the game and is played in just three hours.

                The game of cricket has many rules and regulations, including the use of specific equipment,
                such as a cricket bat, ball, and stumps. The field of play is also important, with a specific
                size and shape required for the pitch.

                Cricket is a sport that is enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds, and it has a rich
                history and culture. It is not just a game, but a way of life for many people around the world,
                with passionate fans and players who take great pride in their national teams and competitions.
                Whether you are a casual fan or a die-hard cricket enthusiast, there is always something to
                enjoy about this great sport.
